	- Individual user sets access control mechanism to allow or deny access to an object
	- Identity-based access control
	- Access policy defined by users
	- Users can pass rights to other subjects and programs
	- Vulnerable from trojan horses exploting access privileges

	- E.g. The law allows a court to access driving records without the owners permission
	- Rule based access control
	- Access policy defined by system
	- Subjects and their programs can't pass rights
