NameNode
	- Keeps track of which blocks make up a file and where they are stored 
	- Stores metadata of the HDFS in a fsimage
	- Updates the file system, does not change the fsimage file
	- When started the namenode loads the fsimage file then applies the changes
FSimage
	- Acts as the settings for the NameNode
Secondary NameNode
	- NOT a backup of the primary node
	- It reads the log files and applies changes to the fsimage file to bring it up to date
	- Allows the NameNode to restart faster
DataNode
	- Stores the actual data in HDFS
	- Can run on any underlying filesystem (ext3/4,NTFS,ect) 
	- Notifies NameNode of what block it has as block reports
Data Retreval
	-When a client wants to retreive data
		- Communicates with the namenode to determine which blocks make up a file
		  and on which DataNodes those blocks are stored
		Then Communicate directly with the datanodes to read the data

Hadoop MapReduce 
	- JobTracker determines the execution plan for the job and assigns individual tasks
		- Splits up data into smaller tasks and sends it to the tasktracker
		- Keeps the work as close to the data as possible
	- TaskTracker keeps track of the performance of an individual mapper or reducer
		- Reports back to the JobTracker node and reports on job progress, sends
		  data or requests new jobs
