GPIO Pins


Serial and Parallel I/O
    - How do we interface external signals
        - Intel 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interpface
        - Motorola 6820 Peripheral Interface Adapter
    - The standard provides general-purpose I/O lines and control lines

    -------------- AXI Bus

        ----------
        |  GPIO  |   Developed to Interpface into the AXI Bus (^75 Signals (Wires)), Can be Slotted into the AXI Bus without having to worry about compatability

        ----------   

- GPIO Provides all signals/connections to the AXI Bus
- Can Have 1 or 2 Channels of 32 bits each
- Each Bit can be configured input or output

- GPIO_TRI= sets up direction and use of Tri-State
    - 0 : write(output) (turns on tristate connections)
    - 1 : reat(input) (disables tristate connections)
    - If tri state buffer is enabled it stops incoming signals 


- GPIOx_DATA:= Port for Data  
    - If config as output
        - Writing to it will output the Data
        - Bit cannot be read
    - If a bit configured as Input 
        - Reading will bring in value
        - Writing to it won't do anything
    - Reason for Volotile Int is to prevent compiler from optomizing repetative and redundant input output information
